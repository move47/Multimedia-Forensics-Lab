## How to execute?
The program on compilation asks for choice:-
1. Encoding 
2. Decoding
3. EXIT

On choosing either 1 and 2, it will ask for the __secret key__.  Here, in this algorithm this key is seed to *Pseudo Random Number Generator(PRNG)*.
By default the program use provided __`cover_audio.wav`__ as audio file for embedding the secret message defined in `17CS02011_Assignment.py`.
### Note
> `XXKB.wav` are output audio files after embedding XX KB amount of secret message in cover_audio.wav
